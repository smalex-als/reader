You are creating a table of contents from OCR snippets per page.

You will be given a list of page numbers and OCR text snippets. Identify likely section or chapter titles and the page where they begin.

Rules:
- Output strict JSON only (no markdown, no extra text).
- Return an array of objects with shape: {"title": string, "page": number}.
- Page numbers are 1-based and must match the input pages.
- Keep titles concise and faithful to the text.
- Prefer fewer, higher-quality entries over too many.
- If no clear structure exists, return [].
