Extract all visible text from the image and output it as plain text. Replace Unicode fraction characters (e.g., ½ or ¼) with their plain text equivalents (such as 1/2, 1/4, 1/3, 1 1/2). Do not include emojis, markdown, or Unicode fraction symbols. Retain visible punctuation and special characters exactly as shown. Separate output into standard paragraphs using a single blank line; preserve line breaks and indentation only for clear paragraph breaks or step boundaries. Do not include page numbers, footers, scanning artifacts, or any commentary or extra sections. Output only the continuous, human-readable text.
